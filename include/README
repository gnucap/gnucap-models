README for spice-wrapper.cc

... used to wrap spice devices into Gnucap. Currently works for spice3f5,
bsim, jspice and ngspice devices. Generally, no modifications in the devices
are needed. Exceptions are compilation fixes and functionality tweaks.

== compilation fixes

We need to compile the spice wrapper with spice headers included. This
involves a mix of C++ and C code of various standards in a single compilation
unit. Some of this can be resolved with preprocessor hacks, sometimes a clean
solution is not known.

The typical clashes originate from different meanings of "auto" and "bool"
across C standards. Another one is the return type of malloc. Code changes in
spice code are tagged with "gnucap" for discoverability.

Improvements are welcome.

== functional fixes and bugs

Sometimes a little tweak is needed to unlock use cases not considered in the
original code.  The main one is the SenCond fix. It enables small signal
analysis during transient simulations in Gnucap. Described in more detail
where used.

Some devices have real bugs that go beyond convergence issues. Generally, we
aim for bug-2-bug compatibilty, and no attempt is made at fixing, rather than
documenting the issue.

== device parameter mapping

Device parameters are those from the spice device. The simulator currently
supports a couple more temperature related parameters and, since recently,
hierarhical system parameters from Verilog-AMS. Such parameters are rejected
by the spice wrapper, but can be set directly by the parser, if desired.

Current lang_spice adds $mfactor, and diverts m to $mfactor if it does not
exist in the device. This is meant to aid bug discovery and test completeness.

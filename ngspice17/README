This package contains the complete set of models from NG-Spice-17.

The models are licensed under Berkeley's license.  See the file
COPYING for details.  Note that this is not GPL.

The "Include" directory contains files from NG-spice. 

There are no modifications to any of the model code, other than to add
a "Makefile" and "wrapper.h" for each one, except for a bug fix in vbic.

They have been minimally tested.  Most of the semiconductor models
appear to work.  Minimal testing means that one or two tests were run
on some of them, and they appear to give believable reslts.  A few
tests were run comparing to references supplied by Berkeley, and the
results match within set tolerances.

Some models, such as bjt2 and bsim3v1s, are considered experimental by
the NG-spice team.

In some cases, more recent models are available from the NG-spice CVS.
They are not included here because I want to use the released version.
If you use the new code, you need to add "Makefile" and "wrapper.h".
That should be all that is needed.

Simple models like resistors and capacitors work only if used with a
.model statement.  This is a parser issue that will be fixed.  They
are included here for completeness.  Unless you need the exact spice
model, they are not recommended.  The gnucap native code has all the
features and more, and gives significantly better performance.

Transmission line models have not been tested.  Some of them load, but
that is all.  They probably don't work.

Some models fail on attachment.  Most of the ones that fail would not
be recommended even if they did work.  The gnucap native models have
better performance.

"-" means there is a problem.

"+", "loads" means that it loads with no reported error.

"++" means passes a quick check, and looks sane.

"+++" means passes a real check, and looks sane.

"++++", "tested" means that it has been tested, with results confirmed 
against an appropriate reference.

"+++++", means that it has been tested and works correctly, and
included in multiple regressions.

In most cases, the NGspice models work the same as the Spice3f5 models
of the same name, and can be used intechangeably.

In all cases, "binning" dosn't work, and handling of initial conditions
(UIC) is incomplete.


More detailed status:

bjt:
Model is slightly different than 3f5.
"gmin" is applied different, so some tests don't match 3f5.
Convergence seems to be a little worse than other versions,
but gmin is less intrusive so it is probably more accurate.
3f5 has a variable gmin that depends on "tf", which is missing here.

To specify the "off" parameter, you must say "off=1", not just "off".

bsim1:
Small differences between this bsim1.so vs. d_mos4.model.
d_mos4.model matches NG-spice, the program.
This bsim1.so matches the bsim1.so from spice3f5.
Differences do not appear to be significant, from a circuit viewpoint,
but are different enough to wonder why.

dio:
In Spice-2, setting bv=0 is equivalent to not setting it.
In Spice-3, setting bv=0 really sets bv to zero, leading to
convergence problems in the breakdown region.  These problems show in
NG-spice, too, so it isn't the plugin mechanism.

sw:
It has the same problems in gnucap as it has in spice.
No time step control, bad results and convergence failures.
Good correlation with Spice, even when incorrect.
The NGspice model has significant changes compared to the Spice3f5
model, but the same issues remain.

vbic:
does not seem to work in vbic_diffamp.cir


MODIFICATIONS:

It is intended that spice models work without modification, but some
have bugs.

Small signal parameters bug:

Spice does not allow AC after transient, but gnucap does, exposing a
bug in some models in storage of parameters for.  The parameters
stored are messed up and need to be patched.  In Spice, the
sensitivity command required proper saved values, so it is fixed in
this case.  For some reason I don't understand, there is a "if
(SenCond)" statement that puts the fix only there.  To fix, change to
"if (1)" so those values are always saved.

This applies to "bjt", "bjt2", "dio", and "vbic", but not all have
been tested for this.

The symptom is incorrect AC results after a transient analysis when
the dynamic part of the model (capacitance) has a big effect.  It
doesn't show after a low frequency transient analysis, or after a DC
or OP analysis.

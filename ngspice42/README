dio:
- works pretty much like ngspice17
- except noise & m looks broken, see dio.noise0m.gc
- need to revisit SenCond, maybe TranSEN could do it?

bjt:
- SenCond patch applied
- sign flipped in ic, ie, ib probes, relative to ngspice17 version
- c* probes have been removed

jfet:
- same results as ngspice17 version

bsim1:
- tests are d_mos4*ckt, "level 4"

bsim3
- d_mos8*ckt: very little difference to ngspice17 version
- vth, vdsat, cgs, cgd probes added

mos6
- essentially same results as gnucap d_mos6
- missing probes from gnucap tests, v{d,g,b,s}m ...

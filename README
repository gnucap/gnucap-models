== Free models for Gnucap from various sources.

- spice3f5: Models from the legacy (legendary?) SPICE3.
- ngspice*: Models from the ngspice project
- jspice*: Models from another SPICE3 variant
- bsim*: Models from UC Berkeley written in C
- ..

== Installation:

- requires gnucap >= 20240430-dev
- type make
- make install

== Use (under construction)

Gnucap loads plugins with either the "-a" command line flag

$ gnucap -a plugin_filename
gnucap> _

or with the attach (aka load) command
$ gnucap
gnucap> load plugin_filename

Both methods use the same path resolution method.

- plugin_filename starts with a dot, '.':
  find relative to current working directory of the process.
- plugin filename starts with slash, '/':
  absolute path
- next, environment variables are considered
  GNUCAP_PLUGPATH is a colon separated list of directories
- finally, the default plugpath, usually $pkglibdir = $libdir/gnucap
  aka $prefix/lib/gnucap, default: /usr/local/lib/gnucap is considered.

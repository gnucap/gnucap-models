09-08-2013 -- Synopsys
BSIM4.8beta code package was received from Navid on 8/30/2013.  Based upon this package, Synopsys made the following code changes to cover
1) Global Foundries and CMC request of mobmod=4/5/6 formulator support
2) An incorrect model derivative computation, ie. dVbseff_dVb is double counted for the derivative w.r.t bulk for Igcs/Igcd
3) Instance parameter off related code was missing in the original code package, Fixed into the new package.
 
Details about each fix is listed as following: 

1) for mobmod=4/5/6 support
b4ld.c:
Line1457~Line1509, add mobmod=5/6. The usage of mobmod=4/5/6 is
Mobmod=4 is based on mobmod=0
Mobmod=5 is based on mobmod=1
Mobmod=6 is based on mobmod=2

b4set.c: 
Line80, change mobmod checking criteria, allow mobmod=5/6


2) For incorrect derivative of dVbseff_dVb 
b4ld.c, Line2610, comment out dT7_dVb *= dVbseff_dVb, because dVbseff_dVb already considered in Line 2660 and 2664

3) for incorrect off handling: 
bsim4def.h:
Line 134, change BSIM4voff to BSIM4off

b4par.c
74,76c74,75
<         case BSIM4_VOFF:
<             here->BSIM4voff = value->iValue;
<             here->BSIM4voffGiven=TRUE;
---
>         case BSIM4_OFF:
>             here->BSIM4off = value->iValue;

4) Bug Fix: derivative issue in igcMod=2, lines 2548  and 2549 in b4ld.c 
   
< dVaux_dVd = -dVgs_eff_dVg * dVth_dVd;
< dVaux_dVb = -dVgs_eff_dVg * dVth_dVb;

> dVaux_dVd = -dVaux_dVg* dVth_dVd;
> dVaux_dVb = -dVaux_dVg* dVth_dVb
